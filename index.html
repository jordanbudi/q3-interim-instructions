    <h3>Computer Science 1 - Interim 3 Final Assessment</h3>
    <h3>Time Limit: 80minutes</h3>
    <p>
      We have spent this past Interim working on programming. The difference between programming and web design (which we did in interim 2), is that programming gets computers to execute logic, while web design just displays things on a screen. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Today's interim will give you the opportunity to display your knowledge and understanding of programming structures that are the fundamentals building blocks that allow computers to execute this logic on our behalf.</p>

      If you get an error when trying to create a new workspace, delete some old workspaces first, then try again. If the error still persists, raise your hand and ask the test proctor to call for Mr. Budisantoso

    </h3>
    <p>
      Functions are used to organize our code up into manageable sections (modularity), or create sections of code that can be reused (reusability). Show me that you know how to create a function and call it whatever you want. Think back to the p5 flower example. The idea here is to show me that you know how to resuse the code in functions elsewhere in your program.

    </h3>
    <p>
      Variables are powerful because not only can they hold values, but they can change throughout your program when we need them to. I need you to show me that you know how to declare, initialize, and use variables. One way is to create a shape that moves across the screen. We've done this in several of our class assignments.

      Task 8: Implement the use of a conditional statement (if/else).
    </h3>
    <p>
        Conditional logic is one of the cornerstones of getting computers to "think." Show me that you know how to use a conditional statement in anyway you can. We've done assignments that stated "if this mouse moves past this point, change the background color," or "if the user clicks the mouse, draw this shape here," or "if the shape moves past the edge of the screen, make it go the other way." Feel free to implement a conditional however way you want.

    <h3>
      Task 9: Implement the use of a loop (a while loop OR a for loop).
    </h3>
    <p>
       Loops allow us to create programs that executes large amounts of actions with very little lines of code. We've done a number of examples in class that lets you combine your knowledge of variables and loops to replicate actions. A simple exmaple would be to use a loop to create a row of shapes (like squares or rectangles) by only writing one line for the shape and then wrapping it in a while loop or for loop. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Pro tip: be careful of creating an infite loop (a loop that goes on forever and never ends). Infinite loops will crash your browser. The most common cause of this is that you forgot to increment your variable so that the loop exits.

      Task 10: Create an array and implement the use of an array
    </h3>
    <p>
      The internet has so much data we need to understand the structures that allow us to organize and access that data. Arrays allow us to do that by putting data (called elements) into a list. Show me that you know how to create an array as well as how to access the elements of that array with its index values. The example we did in class was creating an array of numbers, then using those numbers to create circles of various sizes.
